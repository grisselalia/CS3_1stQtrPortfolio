# **Grissel Pagulayan - Q1 End of Lessons Reflections**
## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **Loop** - I've already learned about for and while loops during CS2, so I had an easy time understanding it. It is not all that different from C++. I also learned about the do while loop, which is when you want the action to be executed before checking the condition.

2. **JS Generating Output (Output to browser's console)** - It is quite easy to understand how to generate an output in JS because I just type anything, and it'll show up! I can also use console.log() whenever I want to show an output. 

3. **Conditional Statements (Uses of if-else)** - As I've already learned about how to do this in C++ in my FYP years, I found it easy. It is similar to the C++ way with the if and else statements. The only difference is that in JS, it's "else if" and not "if else". 

4. **Conditional Statements (Switch Statement)** - I have already encountered and discussed this in CS2, so I didn't find it hard to get. It isn't different from how I used it in C++ before. 

5. **JS Variable Declaration** - It's very simple, and JS isn't really that strict regarding the variables compared to C++. By time, I got used to the variable declaration in JS because of all the coding I did this quarter.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

1. **JS Functions** - We had this topic last year too, but I didn't understand how to do it in C++. Therefore, since I don't have a clear prior knowledge to the topic, I couldn't really understand how to do it.

2. **JS Generating Output (Output to the Browser Window)** - I get it, but I need a guide on how to code it because I don't remember the format. I need more practice so that it can become muscle memory to me. I keep forgetting what I need to type such as things like: ```<button> type="button" onclick="document.write('Hello World!')> Click Me</button>```. 

3. **Inserting Output Inside an HTML Element** - I just don't get it !! Before every CS LT Coding, I ask if I need the ```document.getElementById("variable").innerHTML```, because if I do, I would probably find another way to do the code... #persevering. I just don't understand why I need to use it and how it works. Why can't I just get the element by myself?!

4. **Custom Functions** - If I can't understand the JS functions... how am I supposed to understand *custom* functions?!? I kind of understand the functions as expression and declaration and the difference between them, but I just don't know how to use it.

5. **Getting Input (Using a Confirm Box)** - Since the confirm box requires me to master how to generate the outputs to the browser window, I can't code it efficiently without needing to look at a cheat sheet to guide me. I must first know how to generate output, and then how to get the input!

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. The answer to all my problems is just to **practice**. I need to familiarize myself with learning how to code using JS.

2. For the functions, I should learn *why* and *how* to code it. Honestly, I just have to **study** and make sure I understand the basics of functions to completely master it.

3. If it ever gets to the point that I actually don't get it, I can **consult**! I can also ask help from my other classmates that understand it.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### Effective Activities:

1. **Coding Exercises** - It helped me apply what I've learned during the lecture. I can know what I still need to work on in terms of coding and knowledge.

2. **Coding Speed Tests** - It helped me see how proficient and efficient I am with coding. It's like hitting 2 birds with 1 stone !! I also like it because it's bonus points if you finish quickly.

### Not Effective Activities:

1. **Kahoot** - I think it just brings out my competitive side..! I don't really have enough time to properly think of an answer, and I feel bad if I get a low rank.

2. **Non-Graded Exercises** - I don't think that it's *not effective*, I just don't know what to put anymore... HEHEHEH! I don't like doing them because it doesn't really contribute to my final grade. It's a good way to practice though.
